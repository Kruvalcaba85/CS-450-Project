# S.a.M - CS 450 Final Project

## Overview
Recommendation systems have become an essential part of our daily lives. With the exponential expansion of readily available media, it can be difficult to expand your taste. Many of the applications we use today have their own algorithms to sort content and present what they think you'll like. We created S.a.M, the AI-enhanced **S**ong **a**nd **M**ovie recommendation system to help expand your interests. Just provide it with one song or movie you already like, and S.A.M will give you 10 recommendations using our algorithms.

## Core Concepts Used
* Content-Based Filtering:
